# Dynamic Pricing with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to implement dynamic pricing strategies. The goal is to optimize the pricing of products on an e-commerce platform, such as Myntra, to maximize revenue and profit while adapting to changing market conditions and customer behaviors.

## Introduction

Dynamic pricing is a strategy where prices are adjusted in real-time based on market demand, competitor pricing, inventory levels, and other factors. This project leverages reinforcement learning to develop an intelligent pricing agent that can make pricing decisions to maximize overall revenue.

### Key Features
- *Dynamic Pricing Agent*: A reinforcement learning agent trained to adjust prices dynamically.
- *Simulation Environment*: A simulated e-commerce environment to test and validate the pricing strategies.
- *Performance Metrics*: Evaluation metrics to assess the effectiveness of the dynamic pricing model.

## Usage

1. *Data Preparation*: Ensure that the historical sales data is placed in the data/ directory.
2. *Training the Model*: Use the Jupyter notebook Dynamic Pricing with Reinforcement Learning.ipynb to train the dynamic pricing model.
3. *Testing the Model*: The notebook also includes steps to test the model using the simulated environment.
4. *Evaluation*: Check the results/ directory for performance metrics and evaluation results.

## Model Description

The dynamic pricing model is based on reinforcement learning, where the agent learns to set prices by interacting with a simulated e-commerce environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards, which are based on sales performance, and adjusts its pricing strategy accordingly.

### Key Components
- *Agent*: The reinforcement learning agent responsible for setting prices.
- *Environment*: A simulated e-commerce platform that provides feedback to the agent based on its pricing decisions.
- *Reward Function*: A function that calculates the reward for the agent, based on revenue and other factors.

### Training Process
1. *Initialization*: Initialize the agent and the environment.
2. *Interaction*: The agent interacts with the environment by setting prices.
3. *Feedback*: The environment provides feedback in the form of rewards.
4. *Learning*: The agent updates its pricing strategy based on the received rewards.

## Results

The performance of the dynamic pricing model is evaluated based on key metrics such as revenue, profit, and customer satisfaction. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the reinforcement learning approach in optimizing pricing strategies.

### Key Findings
- The RL-based pricing agent outperforms traditional pricing strategies.
- The agent adapts to changing market conditions and customer behaviors.
